      Putting Purpose at the Core of Your Strategy
    </Heading1>
    <Paragraph>
      Eight years ago we launched a global study of high growth in companies, 
      investigating the importance of three strategies known to drive it: creating new markets, 
      serving broader stakeholder needs, and changing the rules of the game. 
      What we found surprised us. Although each of those approaches did boost 
      growth at the organizations we studied, there was a fourth driver 
      we hadn’t considered at all: purpose.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Companies have long been encouraged to build purpose into what they do. 
      But usually it’s talked about as an add-on—a way to create shared value, 
      improve employee morale and commitment, give back to the community, 
      and help the environment. But as we worked with the high-growth companies
      in our study and beyond, we began to recognize that many of them had moved 
      purpose from the periphery of their strategy to its core—where, with 
      committed leadership and financial investment, they had used it to 
      generate sustained profitable growth, stay relevant in a rapidly changing 
      world, and deepen ties with their stakeholders.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Two Critical Roles
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      In the course of our research, we talked to scores of C-level executives. 
      They worked at 28 companies—in the United States, Europe, and India—that 
      had had an average compound annual growth rate of 30% or more in the 
      previous five years. What we learned from those conversations was that 
      purpose played two important strategic roles: It helped companies redefine 
      the playing field, and it allowed them to reshape the value proposition. 
      And that, in turn, enabled them to overcome the challenges of slowing 
      growth and declining profitability.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Role 1: Redefining the playing field.
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      What’s a key difference between low-growth and high-growth companies? 
      The former spend most of their time fighting for market share on one playing 
      field, which naturally restricts their growth potential. And because most 
      aggressive battles take place in industries that are slowing down, gains 
      in market share come at a high cost, often eroding profits and competitive 
      advantage as offerings become commoditized.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      High-growth companies, by contrast, don’t feel limited to their current 
      playing field. Instead, they think about whole ecosystems, where connected 
      interests and relationships among multiple stakeholders create more 
      opportunities. But these firms don’t approach ecosystems haphazardly. 
      They let purpose be their guide.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Consider the different strategies adopted by the two leading companies 
      in the pet-food industry: Nestlé Purina PetCare, the largest player in 
      North America; and Mars Petcare, the global leader. The companies have 
      defined very similar purposes for themselves—“Better with pets” (Purina) 
      and “A better world for pets” (Mars Petcare)—and both want to develop new 
      products that will help customers improve their pets’ health. But Purina 
      has continued to focus on the pet-food playing field and is applying purpose 
      in some inspiring social initiatives, whereas Mars Petcare is using purpose 
      to propel its expansion in the broader field of pet health.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Mars Petcare, which had established a foothold in pet health with the 
      acquisition of Banfield Pet Hospital in 2007, decided to build its presence 
      in that arena by buying two other veterinary services: BluePearl in 2015 and 
      VCA in 2017. Then in 2018 Mars Petcare entered the European veterinary market, 
      buying the Swedish company AniCura, which has operations in seven European 
      countries, and the British company Linnaeus. Those acquisitions helped Mars 
      Petcare become Mars Inc.’s largest and fastest-growing business division.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In moving deeper into this larger ecosystem, Mars Petcare did more than just 
      capitalize on a burgeoning industry. It also shifted its orientation beyond 
      products to services, a radical change for an asset-heavy company that for 75 
      years had relied on the production and sale of goods. To succeed, the company 
      had to build completely different core competencies and devise a new organizational 
      structure. Many companies in this dangerously open-ended situation might have 
      flailed, but Mars Petcare did not. It was able to pull off a transformation because 
      it ensured that every move it made was aligned with the same core purpose. And it’s 
      not done yet: The company is now bringing that sense of purpose to efforts to expand 
      into pet-activity monitoring with “smart” collars.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Another company that has used purpose to redefine the playing field, this time in the 
      industrial sector, is the Finnish oil-refining firm Neste. For more than six decades 
      Neste, founded in 1948, operated a business focused almost entirely on crude oil, but 
      by 2009 it was struggling. The market was glutted, oil prices had dropped sharply, 
      margins were falling, and the EU had passed new carbon-emissions legislation. During 
      the previous two years the company’s market value had shrunk by 50%.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Fighting those headwinds, the executive team, led by Neste’s new CEO, Matti Lievonen, 
      realized that the company could no longer survive on its traditional playing field. It 
      would have to look for new opportunities in the larger ecosystem. Renewable energy 
      could be a key driver of growth, they realized. Their purpose, they decided, should 
      be to develop sustainable sources of energy that would help reduce emissions, and 
      everything they did would be guided by a simple idea: “Creating responsible choices 
      every day.”
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      It’s common for major oil companies to nod to sustainability in some way, but Lievonen 
      quickly proved that Neste meant business, launching a bold transformation that would 
      become a seven-year journey. Employees, customers, and investors all initially resisted 
      the change, but Lievonen and his team were undaunted. They made major investments in 
      infrastructure, innovated renewable technologies, focused on converting customers to 
      green energy solutions, and, most important, engineered a fundamental change in the 
      company’s culture.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The process wasn’t easy. When Lievonen was just three months into his tenure, a 
      leading economic magazine in Finland published an article saying that he should 
      be fired. He soldiered on, however, and by 2015 Neste had established itself as 
      the world’s largest producer of renewable fuels derived from waste and residues. 
      A year later its comparable operating profits from renewables would surpass those 
      of its oil-products business. In 2017 the company took yet another step by actively 
      researching and promoting the use of waste feedstock from new sources such as algae 
      oil, microbial oil, and tall oil pitch.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Role 2: Reshaping the value proposition.
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      When confronted with eroding margins in a rapidly commodifying world, companies often 
      enhance their value propositions by innovating products, services, or business models. 
      That can bring some quick wins, but it’s a transactional approach geared toward 
      prevailing in the current arena. Because a purpose-​driven approach facilitates growth 
      in new ecosystems, it allows companies to broaden their mission, create a holistic 
      value proposition, and deliver lifetime benefits to customers.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Companies can make this shift in three main ways: by responding to trends, building 
      on trust, and focusing on pain points.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Responding to trends. In line with its purpose of “contributing to a safer society,” 
      Sweden’s Securitas AB, a security company with 370,000 employees, has traditionally 
      offered physical guarding services. But in the early 2010s its CEO at the time, Alf 
      Göransson, saw that globalization, urbanization, and the increasingly networked business 
      landscape were all changing the nature of risk—for people, operations, and business 
      continuity. At the same time, labor was becoming more expensive, and new technologies 
      were becoming cheaper. Given those developments, Göransson decided that Securitas could 
      no longer “simply sell man-hours.” Instead, the company had to explore new ways of 
      using electronics to provide security. This shift, Göransson understood, was not a 
      threat to the existing business but an opportunity to grow—as indeed it has proved to be.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In 2018 the company decided to go a step further and reshape its value proposition from 
      reactive to predictive security, a plan that once again built on the company’s core 
      purpose. Under the leadership of Göransson’s successor, Magnus Ahlqvist, the firm 
      strengthened its electronic security business by acquiring a number of companies, 
      investing heavily in modernizing and integrating back-office systems, and training 
      its guards in remote surveillance, digital reporting, and efficient response. That 
      allowed Securitas to offer bundled, customized security solutions—encompassing physical 
      guarding, electronic security, and risk management—that provided a much-enhanced level 
      of protection at an optimized cost. By expanding its value proposition in this way, 
      Securitas has been able to strengthen client relationships and significantly increase 
      its margins for the solutions business. From 2012 to 2018 the company’s sales of security 
      solutions and electronic security also increased, from 6% of total revenue to 20%.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Building on trust. When Mahindra Finance, the financial services arm of the Mahindra 
      Group, a $20 billion Indian conglomerate, wanted to define its value proposition, it 
      looked to its parent company’s longtime purpose-driven strategy of improving customers’ 
      lives—encapsulated in 2010 by the simple motto “Rise.” It’s a word that the company’s 
      third-generation leader, Anand Mahindra, expects will inspire employees to accept no 
      limits, think alternatively, and drive positive change.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In keeping with that strategy, Mahindra Finance decided to target its core offering, 
      vehicle financing, to rural areas, where it could—as Rajeev Dubey, the group head of 
      HR, put it to us—“address the unmet needs of underserved customers in an underpenetrated 
      market.”
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      That meant that the company had to figure out how to determine the creditworthiness of 
      customers who were mostly poor, illiterate, and unbanked, with no identity documents, 
      no collateral, and cash flows that were often impacted by monsoons. To do that, the 
      company had to develop completely new ways to handle loan design, repayment terms, 
      customer approval, branch locations, and disbursement and collection in cash. Not only 
      that, but it had to figure out how to recruit workers who could speak local dialects, 
      assess local situations, and operate under a decentralized model of decision making.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Remarkably, the company managed to do all those things and established a preliminary 
      level of trust with its customers. It then stretched its value proposition to help 
      farmers and other customers obtain insurance for their tractors, lives, and health. 
      In a country where insurance penetration is abysmally low (about 3.5%), this was no 
      small feat, especially since rural residents didn’t easily part with any minuscule 
      monthly surplus they had, even if it was to secure their livelihood.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Then Mahindra Finance extended its purpose-driven efforts to housing finance, another 
      arena in which it recognized that it could help its rural customers rise above their 
      circumstances. For most of those people, securing loans for housing was difficult in 
      the extreme. Banks offered loans at an interest rate of about 10% but demanded 
      documentation most rural residents couldn’t provide. Moneylenders offered instant 
      financing but charged interest rates of about 40%. Recognizing an opportunity, 
      Mahindra Finance decided to play at the intermediate level, offering customized 
      home loans at rates of about 14%, an option that appealed to its growing base of 
      customers. And when some of those customers developed successful small agribusinesses, 
      they began looking for working-capital loans, equipment loans, project finance, 
      and so on—more unmet needs that Mahindra Finance could address. So it extended its 
      value proposition again, into the small-to-medium-enterprise arena, offering finance 
      and asset-management services.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Throughout its expansion, Mahindra Finance was guided by its goal of helping rural 
      citizens improve their lives. The company identified and committed itself to value 
      propositions that allowed it to deepen its relationship with its customers, which 
      in turn created additional streams of revenue and profits. Today Mahindra Finance 
      is India’s largest rural nonbanking financial company, serving 50% of villages and 
      6 million customers.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Focusing on pain points. We’ve already seen how Mars Petcare’s health care value 
      proposition led to direct connections with pet owners at multiple touchpoints. 
      Having established them, the company looked for other ways to create “a better 
      world for pets.” How could it come up with a value proposition that would make 
      pet ownership a seamless, convenient, and attractive experience?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The answer was by investing in technology to help address one of the biggest 
      concerns of pet owners: preventing health problems. In 2016 the company acquired 
      Whistle, the San Francisco–based maker of a connected collar for activity monitoring 
      and location tracking—a kind of Fitbit for dogs. Teaming the device up with its 
      Banfield Pet Hospital unit, the company launched the Pet Insight Project, a 
      three-year longitudinal study that aims to enroll 200,000 dogs in the United 
      States. By combining machine learning, data science, and deep veterinary expertise, 
      the project seeks to understand when behavior may signal a change in a pet’s health 
      and how owners can partner with their veterinarians on individualized diagnostics 
      and treatments for their pets.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Developing a Purpose
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      Leaders and companies that have effectively defined corporate purpose typically 
      have done so with one of two approaches: retrospective or prospective.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The retrospective approach builds on a firm’s existing reason for being. It requires 
      that you look back, codify organizational and cultural DNA, and make sense of the 
      firm’s past. The focus of the discovery process is internal. Where have we come from? 
      How did we get here? What makes us unique to all stakeholders? Where does our DNA 
      open up future opportunities we believe in? These are the kinds of questions leaders 
      have to ask.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Anand Mahindra very successfully employed this tactic at the Mahindra Group. First 
      he looked back at his 30 years at the company and at the values that had guided him 
      as its leader. Then he delved into the psyche of the organization by conducting 
      internal surveys of managers at all levels. He also did ethnographic research in 
      seven countries to identify themes that resonated with his company’s multinational, 
      cross-cultural employee base. The process took three years, but ultimately Mahindra 
      arrived at “Rise,” which, he realized, had been fundamental to the company from its 
      inception. “‘Rise’ is not a clever tagline,” he has said. “We were already living 
      and operating this way.”
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The prospective approach, on the other hand, reshapes your reason for being. It 
      requires you to look forward, take stock of the broader ecosystem in which you want 
      to work, and assess your potential for impact in it. The idea is to make sense of 
      the future and then start gearing your organization for it. The focus is external, 
      and leaders have to ask a different set of questions: Where can we go? Which trends 
      affect our business? What new needs, opportunities, and challenges lie ahead? What 
      role can we play that will open up future opportunities for ourselves that we 
      believe in?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The prospective approach can be particularly useful for new CEOs. In 2018, when 
      Magnus Ahlqvist took charge at Securitas, he spearheaded a “purpose workstream” to 
      capture aspirations for the company from the ground up. He asked all his business-unit 
      leaders to run “listening workshops” (with groups of employees from diverse functions, 
      levels, age groups, genders, and backgrounds), which were held over six months. At the 
      end of that period, the findings were collated and analyzed. Among the discoveries: 
      Employees had a vision of transforming the company from a service provider to a trusted 
      adviser. That shift would require anticipating and responding to security issues instead 
      of relying on the legacy methods of observing and reporting. So employee input helped 
      executives refine the firm’s predictive-security strategy.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Implementing a Purpose-Driven Strategy
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      Our research shows that a compelling purpose clarifies what a company stands for, 
      provides an impetus for action, and is aspirational. But some purpose statements are 
      so generic that they could apply to any company (like Nissan’s, “Enriching people’s lives”), 
      while others provide only a narrow description of the company’s existing businesses (like 
      Wells Fargo’s, “We want to satisfy our customers’ financial needs and help them succeed 
      financially”). Even if organizations do manage to define their purpose well, they often 
      don’t properly translate it into action—or do anything at all to fulfill it. In those cases 
      the purpose becomes nothing more than nice-sounding words on a wall.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Leaders need to think hard about how to make purpose central to their strategy. The two 
      best tactics for doing that are to transform the leadership agenda and to disseminate 
      purpose throughout the organization.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Consider Mars Petcare again. In 2015 its president, Poul Weihrauch, significantly altered 
      the composition and focus of the leadership team. Its new collective agenda, he declared, 
      would go beyond the performance of individual businesses; it would include generating 
      “multiplier effects” among the businesses (such as between pet food and pet health) and 
      increasing their contributions to creating a better world for pets.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In keeping with that principle, Weihrauch had the company adopt an “outside-in” approach 
      to meeting stakeholder needs. As part of this effort, in 2018 Mars Petcare launched two 
      new programs to support start-ups innovating in pet care: Leap Venture Studio, a business 
      accelerator formed in partnership with Michelson Found Animals and R/GA; and Companion Fund, 
      a $100 million venture-capital fund in partnership with Digitalis Ventures. In announcing 
      these initiatives the company declared that its ambition was “to become a partner of choice 
      for everyone willing to change the rules of the game in pet care.”
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Revising a leadership agenda and restructuring an organization are arguably easier at a 
      privately held company like Mars Petcare than at a publicly held one. But Finland’s Neste 
      is public, with a major stake held by the government, and it has managed to do both things 
      very effectively.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Neste faced an uphill battle when it decided to move into renewables. The company had to 
      build new capabilities while confronting strong opposition from many employees who didn’t 
      buy into the change in direction. About 10% of them left during the first year of the strategy’s 
      implementation. Painful as it was, it proved to be a positive development, since the company 
      could not have forged ahead with people who didn’t believe in its new purpose.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      And forge ahead it did. Neste put in place a new top management team, mobilized its 1,500 R&D 
      engineers, innovated patented renewable technology, and invested €2 billion in building new refineries.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The shift also raised a big question for Neste. How could it change its organizational mindset 
      from volume to value selling—which entailed convincing customers that its clean fuels would be 
      better for them in the long run? That shift meant going beyond wholesalers to work directly with 
      the distributors and even the distributors’ customers. The new leadership team realized that a 
      much higher level of collaboration among business segments and functions was imperative. 
      Winning deals was no longer the sole responsibility of the sales department. The expertise 
      of the whole organization—product knowledge, marketing, finance, taxation—would be required 
      to understand the specific needs of customers like airlines and bus fleets. So Neste engineered 
      a major reorganization and created a matrix structure, in the process rotating about 25% of 
      senior managers and about 50% of upper professionals into new positions. Targets and incentive 
      plans became cross-functional, designed to build capabilities both within and across businesses. 
      And at every step, purpose helped everybody in the company understand the “why” (the business 
      environment’s increasing emphasis on sustainability), the “what” (value-creation programs offering 
      renewable solutions to customers, which in turn generated higher margins for Neste), and the “how” 
      (changing from a sales organization to a key-account management model with dedicated people 
      responsible for strategic customers).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The process worked. Neste is now a leader in the renewables industry, and the world is starting 
      to pay attention. In 2015, for example, Google and UPS began partnering with the company to 
      reduce their carbon emissions, as did several cities in California, among them San Francisco 
      and Oakland. In 2018, Forbes ranked Neste second on its Global 100 list of the world’s 
      most-sustainable companies.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Benefits on the Soft Side
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      Purpose can also help with the soft side of management—the people-related aspects of running 
      a business, which so often prove to be the undoing of leaders. By putting purpose at the core 
      of strategy, firms can realize three specific benefits: more-unified organizations, more-motivated 
      stakeholders, and a broader positive impact on society.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Unifying the organization. When companies pursue dramatic change and move into larger ecosystems,
      as both Mars Petcare and Securitas have done, it’s unsettling for employees. Why does a pet-food 
      company need to develop a platform to support technology start-ups? Why does an on-site guarding 
      company want to provide electronic security services that could, over time, make the physical 
      presence of guards redundant? Purpose helps employees understand the whys and get on board with 
      the new direction.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Motivating stakeholders. According to the Edelman trust barometer, distrust of government, 
      businesses, the media, and NGOs is now pervasive. At the same time, more than ever, employees, 
      especially Millennials, want to work for organizations that can be trusted to contribute to a 
      higher cause. And when customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders see that a company has a 
      strong higher purpose, they are more likely to trust it and more motivated to interact with it.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Broadening impact. Strategy involves exploring some fundamental questions. Why are we in this 
      business? What value can we bring? What role does my unit play within the bigger portfolio? 
      Purpose creates a basis for answering those questions and defining how each unit will contribute 
      to the organization and to society as a whole. This focus on collective objectives, in turn, 
      opens up many more opportunities to improve growth and profitability today and in the future.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>
      Conclusion
    </Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      The approach to purpose that we’re recommending cannot be a one-off effort. Leaders need to 
      constantly assess how purpose can guide strategy, and they need to be willing to adjust or 
      redefine this relationship as conditions change. That demands a new kind of sustained focus, 
      but the advantages it can confer are legion.
