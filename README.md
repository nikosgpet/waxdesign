![Text editor demo](./static/demo.png)


This is an interactive prototype of a text editor UI. It is meant as inspiration for the creation of open source collaborative text editors.

As this is a prototype, not a working text editor, most buttons offer very limited functionality.


## Technologies

This prototype is built with SvelteKit

## Run Project

`yarn dev`
